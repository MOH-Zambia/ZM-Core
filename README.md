ZM-Core is an Implementation Guide (IG) designed to profile and standardize HL7 FHIR R5 resources commonly used in Zambia's health systems. This IG provides a foundation for interoperability across health information systems within the country by defining profiles, extensions, and guidance for FHIR resources specific to Zambian health use cases.

### Purpose
The ZM-Core IG aims to:
- Define standard FHIR R5 profiles for resources commonly used in Zambia health systems
- Establish a baseline for health data interoperability across Zambian health facilities
- Provide guidance for implementing FHIR-based solutions in the Zambian health context
- Support digital health initiatives and data exchange standards
